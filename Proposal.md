In this lab, we are going to analyze [US mess shooting data](https://www.kaggle.com/sorzhe/us-mass-shooting/data). Mass shooting is cursively defined as a shooting case which has more than two victims. In our data set, the least victim is three and the greatest is 585.

Our initiation to focus on mass shooting was inspired by our concern with the recently happened Las Vegas shooting case. As we read [CNN's report of details inside Las Vegas shooting case](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/13/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation/index.html), our worry was raised that such a catastrophe will probably happen in the future. Thus, we decide to study the past and try to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.

Another point motivating us to study this data is the fact that US actually has the most shooting cases in human history. To get rid of such a violent and dangerous global figure, people have to find out the causes which drive people to open their fire. Thus, we will study this paper [Why the US has the most mass shootings](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/27/health/u-s-most-mass-shootings/index.html) to come out with crucial factors such as a state's gun policy that could significantly influence people's behavior with guns. Therefore, we also prepare two other references about gun laws. One is the [statements of each state's gun law](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/20/gun-laws-vary-state-by-state-cnbc-explains.html) and the other is an analysis explaining [how and why gun laws vary state by state](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/20/gun-laws-vary-state-by-state-cnbc-explains.html). We hope to illustrate the claims and hypothesis in those references by the support of our use of tools in R studio. To be more specific, we could use the Latitude and Longitude data to build a visualization on US map. Also, we could use select and filter techniques on Data variable to analyze the aftermath of a gun law by comparing the situations before and after the year it announced.
